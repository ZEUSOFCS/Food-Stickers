## Description
The iMessage sticker pack extension allows users to place their favorite food from their favorite restaurants by sending stickers through iMessage.

For example, a customer could place an order and pay for her morning cappuccino while she’s walking to her neighborhood coffee shop, and the drink would be ready to pick up as soon as she’s arrived
